title: Device-Tree for Xilinx Video Timing Controller(VTC)

description:
  Xilinx VTC is a general purpose video timing generator and detector.
  The input side of this core automatically detects horizontal and
  vertical synchronization, pulses, polarity, blanking timing and active pixels.
  While on the output, it generates the horizontal and vertical blanking and
  synchronization pulses used with a standard video system including support
  for programmable pulse polarity.

  The core is commonly used with Video in to AXI4-Stream core to detect the
  format and timing of incoming video data or with AXI4-Stream to Video out core
  to generate outgoing video timing for downstream sinks like a video monitor.
